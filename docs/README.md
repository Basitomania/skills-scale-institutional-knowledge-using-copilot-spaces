# OctoAcme Project Management Process Overview

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation. This guide provides a clear entry point to understand how OctoAcme runs cross-functional projects, from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement.

## How OctoAcme Delivers Projects

OctoAcme follows a structured yet iterative approach to project delivery, emphasizing customer value, clear ownership, and data-informed decisions. Every project moves through five distinct phases: **Initiation**, **Planning**, **Execution**, **Release**, and **Retrospective**. During [Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md), teams validate business needs through a lightweight Project One-pager that defines the problem, success metrics, stakeholders, and initial timeline. Once approved, the project enters [Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md), where the team breaks work into shippable increments, estimates effort, defines acceptance criteria and Definition of Done, and creates a release plan with clear milestones. The [Execution](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md) phase follows a consistent team rhythm with daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and sprint demos, using project boards to track work from backlog through QA to completion. When features are ready, the [Release and Deployment](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md) process ensures all acceptance criteria are met, CI checks pass, smoke tests run, and rollback plans are in place before deploying to production. Finally, the [Retrospective](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md) phase captures learnings and converts them into actionable improvements, completing the cycle and feeding insights back into future projects.

## Roles and Collaboration

Success at OctoAcme depends on clear roles and effective collaboration across the delivery team. The [Project Manager (PM)](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#project-managers) coordinates delivery activities, manages schedules and risks, facilitates meetings, and maintains transparency through consistent status reporting. The [Product Manager (PdM)](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#product-managers) defines what should be built, owns the product vision, prioritizes the backlog based on customer and business value, and validates solutions through user research and metrics. [Developers](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#developers) implement features to meet acceptance criteria, write tests and documentation, participate in design and code reviews, and help identify technical risks. QA and Testing team members validate quality and ensure acceptance criteria are met through unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end smoke tests, and manual testing when needed. Stakeholders provide inputs, approvals, and feedback throughout the project lifecycle. These roles work together through a well-defined [communication cadence](octoacme-project-management-overview.md#communication-cadence) that includes weekly PM-PdM syncs, twice-weekly team standups, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad-hoc escalations as needed.

## Quality Assurance and Process Rigor

OctoAcme maintains high quality standards through multiple layers of verification and structured checklists at every project phase. The [Execution and Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md#quality--testing) process requires unit tests for new logic, integration tests where applicable, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and security scanning in CI pipelines. Pull requests must be small (≤400 lines when possible), include issue links and acceptance criteria, pass automated tests and linting before review, and receive at least one approval before merging. Each project phase has a dedicated checklist: the [Initiation Checklist](octoacme-project-initiation.md#initiation-checklist) ensures one-pagers are reviewed and stakeholder alignment is achieved before planning begins; the [Planning Checklist](octoacme-project-planning.md#planning-checklist) confirms kickoffs are held, backlogs are prioritized, and test plans are drafted; the [Deployment Checklist](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md#deployment-checklist) verifies staging tests pass before production deployment and post-deploy verifications complete; and retrospective action items are tracked with clear owners and due dates. [Risk management](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md) is built into the process through a Risk Register that captures impact, likelihood, mitigation plans, and status, which is reviewed and updated at weekly syncs to ensure early identification and proactive resolution of potential issues.

## Getting Started with These Docs

This documentation set is designed to support both new team members getting oriented and experienced practitioners looking for specific process guidance. Start with the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md) for core principles, roles, and lifecycle stages, then explore phase-specific guides as needed. The [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) document defines responsibilities and communication patterns for each team member. [Risk Management and Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md) provides templates for status updates, incident communication, and escalation paths. For project teams, keep your Project Charter updated in the project repository and consider adding process-specific documentation to `.copilot/` to provide context for Copilot Spaces. Each document includes practical templates, checklists, and decision gates to help teams move efficiently from concept to production while maintaining quality and alignment.
